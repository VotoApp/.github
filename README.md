# Overview

*Voto* is a project started by [Stephen Campbell](https://github.com/Stephen-Campbell1) that provides a suite of tools which provide creators with actionable insights for their content. As the project is in its infancy, a
waitlist signup can be found at https://web.voto.mpbell.dev/.

## A Brief Vision

Voto's #1 objective is to transform a creator's content into a set of actionable insights or critiques that the creator finds useful. This is a *creator obsessed* product. The following is a roadmap of use cases that will be implemented as an iOS application.
